Concordia uses [database-js](https://github.com/mlaanderson/database-js) to access databases and files through a SQL-based interface. The supported SQL syntax may vary from one database to another. In case of problems, please see the [documentation of the corresponding driver](https://github.com/mlaanderson/database-js#drivers).

#### MySQL, PostgreSQL, and ADO databases

Normal syntax, like the aforementioned. Access through ADO currently works only on Windows.

#### JSON and CSV databases

- INSERT accepts only JSON objects or arrays as values
  - Example:
    ```gherkin
    When I run the script 'INSERT INTO [MyDB] VALUES { "name": "Mary", "surname": "Jane", "age": 21 }'
    ```

#### Excel and Firebase databases

Syntax similar to [JSON and CSV databases](#json-and-csv-databases). However, it has some limitations, as pointed out in [its documentation](https://github.com/mlaanderson/database-js-firebase) :

> *SQL commands are limited to SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE. WHERE works well. JOINs are not allowed. GROUP BY is not supported. LIMIT and OFFSET are combined into a single LIMIT syntax: LIMIT [offset,]number*

#### INI databases

- INSERT
  - Not supported yet by [database-js-ini](https://github.com/mlaanderson/database-js-ini)

- DELETE
  - Not supported yet by [database-js-ini](https://github.com/mlaanderson/database-js-ini)

- UPDATE
  - Example:
    ```gherkin
    When I run the script 'UPDATE [MyDB] SET age = 22 WHERE name = "Mary"'
    ```

#### SQLite databases

Currently [database-js-sqlite](https://github.com/mlaanderson/database-js-sqlite) uses [sql.js](https://github.com/kripken/sql.js) that **doesn't persist the changes made to the database**.
