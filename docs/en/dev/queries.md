### References inside queries
- Constant:
  - `[something]` **can** be used whether the project adopts [AlaSQL](https://github.com/agershun/alasql), with the restriction that [it uses](https://github.com/agershun/alasql#read-and-write-excel-and-raw-data-files) only numbers inside brackets, to refer columns of CSV files. E.g., `"SELECT [3] as city, [4] as population from csv( 'path/to/file.csv')"`. So a [Constant](#constants) name could not be a number.
  - `[something]` **can** be used whether the project adopts [Database-JS](https://github.com/mlaanderson/database-js), with the restriction that it uses dollar signs (`$`) to reference rows and columns in Excel files. E.g., `"SELECT * FROM [Sheet1$A1:C52]"`. So [Constants](#constants) names could *not* have dollar signs.
  - References that do not match the format of a [Constant](#constants) name must be ignored, i.e., not replaced by a value.
