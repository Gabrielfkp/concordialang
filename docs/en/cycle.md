# â™º Recommended usage cycle

1. Write or update your requirements specification with the *Concordia Language* and validate it with users or stakeholders;

2. Use *Concordia Compiler* to generate tests from the specification and to run them;

3. If the tests **failed**, there are some possibilities:

    1. You still haven't implemented the corresponding behavior in your application. In this case, just implement it and run the tests again.

    2. Your application is behaving differently from the specification. In this case, it may have bugs or you or your team haven't implemented the behavior exactly like described in the specification.   - Whether the application has a bug, we are happy to have discovered it! Just fix it and run the tests again to make sure that the bug is gone.
      - Otherwise, you can decide between **changing your application** to behave exactly like the specification describes, or **changing the specification** to match your application behavior. In the latter case, back to step `1`.

4. If the tests **passed**, *great job!* Now you can write new requirements or add more test cases, so just back to step `1`.
