# Example

> Here we present a short and simple example, with the purpose of giving an idea on how Concordia works.

Translations: [Portugu√™s](example-pt.md) üåé

We recommend you to read the example even without being used to its [syntax](language/en.md).

`login.feature` :
```gherkin
Feature: Login
  As a user
  I would like to authenticate myself
  In order to access the application

Scenario: Successful login
  Given that I can see the login screen
  When I enter valid credentials
  Then I can access the application's main screen

  # A Variant is a low-level description or variation of a Scenario
  Variant: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given that I am in the [Login Screen]
    When I fill {Username}
      And I fill {Password}
      And I click on {OK}
    Then I see "Welcome"
      And I have ~user is logged in~

Constants:
  - "Login Screen" is "http://localhost/login"

Table: Users
  | username | password  |
  | bob      | 123456    |
  | alice    | 4l1c3pass |

UI Element: Username
  - value comes from "SELECT username FROM [Users]"
    Otherwise I must see "Invalid username"
  - required is true

UI Element: Password
  - value comes from "SELECT password FROM [Users] WHERE username = {Username}"
    Otherwise I must see "Invalid password"
  - required is true

UI Element: OK
  - type is button
```

## 2. Generate and execute tests

Concordia can generate [Test Cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case) and test scripts (source code).

### Test Cases

- Always written in *Concordia Language*
- Declared in `.testcase` files
- Generated from `.feature` files

Test Cases generated from Concordia will always have the same name of the `.feature` file. For instance, `login.feature` will produce `login.testcase`.

You can also write your own `.testcase` files, if it's desired to write additional test cases. However, **we recommend you to create them in files whose names are different from the feature files**, since they could be overwriten otherwise.

### Test Scripts

- Programming language and testing framework depend on the used plug-in
- Generated from Test Cases

Test Scripts generated from Concordia will usually have the same name of the `.feature` file, and will be saved under a subdirectory `test`. For instance `login.testcase` can produce `test/login.js`, whether the plugin for CodeceptJS is used.

You can also write your own Test Scripts. We **recommend you to create them in files whose names are different from those generated by Concordia**, since they could be overwritten otherwise.

### Generation without execution

The following command will generate test cases and test scripts for the framework CodeceptJS, without executing the test scripts.

```console
$ concordia --seed="hello world" --plugin=codeceptjs --no-run --no-result
```

The parameter `seed` is the [random seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed). When the seed is always the same, so is the random values generated by Concordia. Whether it is not informed, Concordia will generate one. Different seeds may raise the chances of discovering new defects, since values and selected paths may vary from execution to execution.

In our example, we inform the seed to get always the same results.

Parameters `no-run` and `no-result` avoid running the test scripts and getting execution results.

### Generation and execution

Make sure that the test server is up. Whether is not active, just run the following:

```console
$ concordia --plugin-serve=codeceptjs
```
The test server will wait for tests. When you wish to finish it later, just type `Ctrl + C`.

Then, let's generate and execute tests:

```console
$ concordia --seed="hello world" --plugin=codeceptjs
```

### Execution without generation

This will not generate test cases or test scripts, but it will execute them and get their results:
```console
$ concordia --plugin=codeceptjs --no-test-case --no-script
```

## Result analysis

Whether you has runned the test scripts above, probably you will see they fail. That's because they didn't find a web application running at `http://localhost/login` or because it did find but the application didn't match the expected behavior.

You may adapt your application, if it has a similar behavior, and then run the tests again.

Concordia shows a report that indicates the reasons of the failures and includes the respective lines of both test cases and test scripts. Thus, you can decide whether a failure is related to the application - that is, it didn't behave as expected - or to the specification - usually if it is outdated in relation to the application.

Now keeping your specification updated has a new clear benefit: you can use it to generate tests and discover existing defects in your application!
