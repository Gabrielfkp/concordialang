![Example](media/example-en.gif)

*Concordia Compiler* is a tool that allows you to generate functional tests from a requirements specification written in *Concordia Language*.  You can use them for:

1. Writing [business-readable](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html) specifications.

2. Generating and executing [functional test cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing) automatically. *No just test script skeletons!* It generates complete test cases and test scripts - with *test data* and *oracles*. You don't even need to know how to write code!

3. Generating test scripts for different testing frameworks, such as [CodeceptJS](https://codecept.io/), through [plug-ins](plugins/README.md).

4. Writing additional test cases when needed, using *Concordia Language* - currently available in **English** (`en`) and **Portuguese** (`pt`). These test cases are converted to test scripts using plugins.

5. Analyzing test results to help evaluating failures.

*Concordia Language* is an [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) requirements specification metalanguage inspired in [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin).

## ‚ùì Why Concordia ?

- Simple [syntax](docs/language/en.md)

- No need to write code

- Separate high-level, **business language** declarations from medium-low-level, **computing language** declarations

- Have complete and relevant tests in few seconds

- High coverage of business rules at a small declaration effort

- Let you describe complex, dynamic business rules, including those related to data from databases

- Have test cases declared in a high-level language

- Create additional test cases without coding

- Generated test cases and test scripts receive comments with related specification, so you can track them

- Available in more than one spoken language

- No special text editor required - use your favorite UTF-8 editor

- Use your favorite [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) to manage changes

- Batteries included (install and use)

- Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac


## üíø Installation

Concordia Compiler requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) version `8` or above.

> Whether you wish to install the plugin CodeceptJS for testing web applications (CodeceptJS + WebDriverIO), it is also needed to install the [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

After NodeJS is installed, run the following command:
```bash
npm install -g concordialang
```

You can test the installation as follows:
```bash
concordia --version
```
Whether a version number is displayed, the installation was successful.

### üîå Installing a plugin

List the available plugins:
```bash
concordia --plugin-list
```

Then install the desired one. For instance:
```bash
concordia --plugin-install codeceptjs
```

Concordia and its plug-ins install all the needed dependencies by default, in order to make the setup process simpler.


## üöÄ Execution

### üñ• Starting a testing server

Sometimes when we run tests against a user interface, it is needed to control the execution through a testing server. For instance, `CodeceptJS` may have to use a `Selenium` server to control the execution of tests for web applications. Without such server, it is not able to work.

Run the following command to start a testing server:

```bash
concordia --plugin-serve <plugin-name>
```

After the server is started, you probably have to run Concordia Compiler in another terminal (console).

### üó≤ Running

```bash
concordia path/to/your/features --plugin <plugin-name>
```

For example, the following command will search for feature files recursively from the current directory.
```bash
concordia --plugin codeceptjs
```

### üñ• Stopping a testing server

It is likely that your testing server remain open after executing all the tests.

Type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to close it.


## üìë Very basic example

> *Example without test data generation, test scenario combination, or most language capabilities.*

**Input**

*search.feature* :

```gherkin
Feature: Google Search

Scenario: Search returns expected result

  Variant: Search content on pressing Enter
    Given that I am on "https://google.com"
    When I type "concordialang.org" in <q>
      And I press "Enter"
    Then I see "npm"
```
**Run**

*Start the test server (once)*
```bash
$ concordia --plugin-serve codeceptjs
```
*Generate and run*
```bash
$ concordia --plugin codeceptjs
```

**Output**

*search.testcase* :
```gherkin
# Generated with ‚ù§ by Concordia
#
# THIS IS A GENERATED FILE - MODIFICATIONS CAN BE LOST !

import "search.feature"

@generated
@scenario(1)
@variant(1)
Test case: Search content on pressing Enter - 1
  Given that I am on "https://google.com"
  When I type "concordialang.org" in <q>
    And I press "Enter"
  Then I see "npm"
```

*search.js* :
```javascript
// Generated with ‚ù§ by Concordia
// source: search.testcase
//
// THIS IS A GENERATED FILE - MODIFICATIONS CAN BE LOST !

Feature("Google Search");

Scenario("Search returns expected result | Search content on pressing Enter - 1", (I) => {
    I.amOnPage("https://google.com"); // (10,5)
    I.fillField("q", "concordialang.org"); // (11,5)
    I.pressKey("Enter"); // (12,7)
    I.see("npm"); // (13,5)
});
```

and it will also **run the tests**.

## ‚ô∫ Recommended usage cycle

1. Write or update your requirements specification with the *Concordia Language* and validate it with users or stakeholders;

2. Use *Concordia Compiler* to generate tests from the specification and to run them;

3. If the tests **failed**, there are some possibilities:

    1. You still haven't implemented the corresponding behavior in your application. In this case, just implement it and run the tests again.

    2. Your application is behaving differently from the specification. In this case, it may have bugs or you or your team haven't implemented the behavior exactly like described in the specification.   - Whether the application has a bug, we are happy to have discovered it! Just fix it and run the tests again to make sure that the bug is gone.
      - Otherwise, you can decide between **changing your application** to behave exactly like the specification describes, or **changing the specification** to match your application behavior. In the latter case, back to step `1`.

4. If the tests **passed**, *great job!* Now you can write new requirements or add more test cases, so just back to step `1`.


## üß† How it works

![Process](media/process.png)

1. It reads your `.feature` and `.testcase` files, and uses a [lexer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) and a [parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing#Computer_languages) to identify and check documents' structure.

2. It uses [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing) (NLP) to identify sentences' [intent](http://mrbot.ai/blog/natural-language-processing/understanding-intent-classification/). This increases the chances of recognizing sentences written in different styles.

3. It performs [semantic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_analysis_(compilers)) to check recognized declarations.

4. It uses the specification to infer the most suitable *test cases*, *test data*, and *test oracles*, and then generates `.testcase` files in Concordia Language.

5. It transforms all the test cases into test scripts (that is, source code) using a plug-in.

6. It executes the test scripts with the plug-in. These test scripts will check your application's behavior through its user interface.

7. It reads and presents execution results. These results relate failing tests to the specification, in order to help you understanding the possible reasons of a failure.
